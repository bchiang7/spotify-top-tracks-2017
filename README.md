# Spotify Top Tracks of 2017

[Project](http://ds4100.weebly.com/project.html) for DS 4100

## Proposal

The data set that I’ll be investigating for my project is the top spotify tracks of 2017. At the end of each year, Spotify compiles a playlist of songs with the most streams over the course of that year. The playlist for 2017, “Top Tracks of 2017: USA”, includes 100 songs. [Spotify Web API Get Several Audio Features](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-several-audio-features/) provides some very interesting audio features for each song. For example: `acousticness`, `danceability`, `energy`, `instrumentalness`, `tempo`, etc. I want to investigate this data and try to determine correlations and trends between these different audio features. In addition to finding patterns in the audio features of these tracks, I also want to try to predict one audio feature based on the others. What do these songs have in common? What makes them so popular?
